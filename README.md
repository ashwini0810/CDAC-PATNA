C-DAC Material
It's important to note that these study notes are focused on C-DAC-related subjects and do not include any personal or self-study which I did separately. I have not updated additional self-study files or programming here.

If you require additional information or if there's anything specific you would like to discuss, please feel free to reach out to me!

Hi,

In my C-DAC Journey, I've gathered all the important study materials I've covered so far. These include different subjects like: Concepts of Programming, Object-Oriented Programming with Java, Web Programming Technologies, Databases Technologies, Web-based Java Programming, Software Development Methodologies, MS .NET, and Data Structures and Algorithms with Java.

For each subject, I've noted down the syllabus to know exactly what topics I have covered and Practice, also include weekly timetables to stay organized and make sure I cover everything effectively. To practice my coding skills, I've been working on various coding problems on different platforms.

In addition, I've included test books to help me prepare for exams and assess my knowledge. This College folder is like my treasure trove, containing all the essential resources I need to excel in my studies and become a better programmer. It's a great way to keep track of my progress and stay on top of my learning journey!
